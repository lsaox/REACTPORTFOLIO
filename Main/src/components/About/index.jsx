        As I prepare to graduate from Southern Methodist University (SMU), I find myself standing at the threshold of an exciting new phase in my Software Engineering journey. Throughout my academic pursuit, my  passion for coding and web development has been the guiding light propelling me towards mastery in Full Stack Development.

My time at SMU has not only allowed me to sharpen my technical skills but has also deepened my understanding of the intricate world of modern web development. Rooted in a strong foundation of HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I specialize in crafting dynamic, user-focused interfaces that prioritize engaging user experiences.

I am excited to channel my self-taught knowledge and academic background into meaningful contributions within innovative professional environments. A strong aspiration of mine is to employ my creative flair in designing intuitive and visually captivating web applications that make a lasting impact.

With commitment to continuous learning and a passion for creating aesthetic and responsive designs, I am well-prepared to embrace fresh challenges and make valuable contributions to cutting-edge projects in the realm of Full Stack development. I welcome the opportunity to connect with discerning employers and explore collaborations aimed at crafting remarkable digital experiences together.        </p>
